# OmniSekai

OmniSekai is a minimalist, gamified personal development app.

Designed as an RPG-like experience, the user is the player and the character simultaneously. Every action in real life becomes a mission. Every habit is a skill. Every tool is an item.

- Tailwind CSS
- Firebase (Auth & Firestore)

## Main Features

- Authentication with Firebase
- User onboarding (Create your character)
- Profile system with XP, Level and Progress
- Future plans:
  - Missions & Quests
  - Skill system
  - Inventory system
  - Theming with light/dark mode
